    "abstract": "**Contribution to the 25th International Workshop on Neutrinos from Accelerators**\\\\\\nSince its discovery, the muon has proven to be an invaluable probe of the Standard Model (SM). Muons are readily available in tertiary beams in facilities around the world. They do not decay hadronically and have a lifetime of a few µs; consequently, muon experiments offer clean, high-statistics environments to make precision measurements and search for new physics that could appear through deviations from the SM expectation. The 2020s have seen a renaissance in muon physics highlighted by the high-profile results from the Fermilab Muon $g - 2$ experiment which continues to provide successive measurements of the muon's anomalous magnetic moment with world-leading precision. In addition, a suite of experiments is coming online to search for new physics in the form of charged lepton flavor violation in the muon sector. These experiments will probe effective mass scales of new physics up to $10^4$ TeV/c$^2$, far beyond the reach of direct searches at colliders. This article explores the motivations, recent results, and status of these experiments.",

Since this discovery, the muon has played a key role in helping us understand physics. Precision measurements of muon decay provide unparalleled insight into the SM. Studies of muon decay both determine the overall strength and establish the chiral structure of weak interactions. The muon's fundamental properties provide experimental advantages. Its mass is $\\\\sim$ 105 MeV/c$^{2}$ meaning that the muon does not decay hadronically; consequently, muon experiments provide very clean environments, with well-understood SM backgrounds. Muons can be created in large numbers as tertiary beams emanating from pion decay as a result of protons on fixed targets. Furthermore, the muon has a lifetime, at rest, of $\\\\sim$ 2.2 $\\\\mu$s, long enough that they can be transported and stored, accumulating high statistics in beams and projected on to targets, but short enough that the decay itself can be utilized. High-precision measurements of the muon's anomalous magnetic moment, $a_{\\\\mu}$, offer sensitivity to the completeness of the SM and beyond SM (BSM) theories that predict deviations from SM expectation. Muon charged lepton flavor violation (CLFV) channels probe a range of well-motivated new physics scenarios. Due to the high-intensity muon beams available at facilities such as PSI, Fermilab and J-PARC, current and projected constraints on muon CLFV channels are orders of magnitude beyond analogous constraints on tau channels. The next generation of muon CLFV experiments will probe effective masses to $10^{4}$ TeV/c$^2$ \\\\cite{bernstein_history}. The present decade is an unprecedented era for muon physics, with experiments at PSI, Fermilab, J-PARC and CERN all planning to take data to either enhance understanding of the muon's anomalous magnetic moment or search for new physics using high-intensity muon beams. This article explores the status of these current and upcoming experiments."

Experiments searching for \\\\MuToEmConv~ must design their tracking detectors for high momentum resolution to mitigate against these tail electrons. For example, Mu2e employs a straw tube tracker made of 20,000, 5 mm diameter thin straws orientated in sets of panels. These panels are oriented in circles ($3 \\\\times 120$ degrees) and along the beam axis, and combined in sets to form panels, two panels form a station. The overlap of straws at varying angles allows for stereo reconstruction. This geometry, along with sophisticated reconstruction algorithms, allows for momentum resolution $<$ 180 MeV/c. In addition, the center of the tracker is kept hollow, already completely blinding the detector to low momentum ( $\\\\lesssim 75 $ MeV/c) electrons from the target."

Mu2e-II \\cite{Mu2eII} is a proposed extension to Mu2e which could be built at Fermilab utilizing the PIP-II beam. Much of the Mu2e hardware would be reused. The projected sensitivity of Mu2e-II is $3 \\times 10^{-18}$. R$\\&$D continues in order to finalize the detector designs for Mu2e-II.

Likewise, searches for muon CLFV are a powerful probe for new physics, with already tight constraints, orders of magnitude below analogous constraints on tau processes. In the coming decade results from MEG-II, Mu3e, COMET and Mu2e will collectively explore an array of new physics operators and are expected to constrain new physics models up to $10^{4}$ TeV/c$^{2}$."

The need for this sensitivity places several stringent requirements on the detector development. The experiment requires to detect the monochromatic electron of 105MeV, the momentum resolution is primarily limited by the multiple scattering effect for this momentum region. Thus we need the very light material detector in order to achieve an excellent momentum resolution, better than 2%, for 100MeV region. In order to fulfil such a requirement, the thin-wall straw-tube planar tracker has been developed by an extremely light material which is operational in vacuum. The COMET straw tracker consists of 9.8mm diameter straw tube, longer than 1m length, with 20-μm-thick Mylar foil and 70-nm-thick aluminium deposition. Currently even thinner and smaller, 12μm thick and 5mm diameter, straw is under development by the ultrasonic welding technique.",

The main purpose of the COMET experiment is to search for charged lepton flavor violating neutrinoless conversion of muons into electrons in the field of a nucleus (μ–e conversion, μ–N → e–N). The goal is to achieve a sensitivity to the branching ratio superior to 10−17, that four orders of magnitude smaller than the present limit. In the experiment a straw detector will be used to measure the momentum of the signal electrons from the μ–e conversion. In order to satisfy the requirements of the momentum measurements, we plan to develop a planar tracking device consisting of thin-wall straws made with an extremely light material to reduce multiple scattering and that is capable of operation in vacuum. Research the mechanical properties of straws will allow us to choose their optimal tension, to estimate the influence of the temperature and humidity, to assess the straws service life in the experiment, which we define as the tension relaxation time to the minimum working value.",

The drift space–time relation, drift velocity, dE/dx resolution, hit efficiency, and spatial resolution as a function of distance from the wire were investigated. The average spatial resolution of 150 μm with the hit efficiency of 99% was obtained at applied voltages higher than 1800V.

            "abstract": "{Power upgrades of accelerators and the development of new beamlines have prompted high-precision measurements to be updated and reveal new phenomena. Several accelerators operate in the mega-watt regime, and a number of experiments are planned for the future, to search for evidence of new physics beyond the standard model by investigating events relevant to secondary particles. Several beamlines will be constructed based on new concepts in high-power proton drivers, i.e., meson factories. These beamlines will transport secondary particles, namely muons, with higher efficiency than conventional beamlines, and are usually dedicated to specific experiments. In this article, we introduce a new beamline concept that can produce a high-intensity muon beam with a wide tunable range of momentum, for application to a wide variety of studies. A new muon beamline based on this concept is under construction in the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC). This beamline is characterized by general versatility, and produces high-intensity muon beams for several experiments, which require different beam and experimental conditions.}",

The detector for DeeMe must tolerate large pulses of prompt charged particles whose instantaneous hit rate is as large as 70 GHz mm−2 in a time width of 200 ns, and detect a single electron that arrives with delayed timing on the order of microseconds. A special wire chamber has been developed with a new dynamic gain control technique that reduces space charge effects. In this paper, we detail the novel detector scheme and operation verification.}",

However, various operator coefficients add coherently in the amplitude for μ→econversion, weighted by nucleus-dependent functions, and therefore in the event of a detection, identifying the relevant new physics scenarios could be difficult. Using a representation of the nuclear targets as vectors in coefficient space, whose components are the weighting functions, we quantify the expectation that different nuclear targets could give different constraints. We show that all but two combinations of the 10 Spin-Independent (SI) coefficients could be constrained by future measurements, but discriminating among the axial, tensor and pseudoscalar operators that contribute to the Spin-Dependent (SD) process would require dedicated nuclear calculations. We anticipate that μ→econversion could constrain 10 to 14 combinations of coefficients; if μ→eγ and μ→ee¯e constrain eight more, that leaves 60 to 64 “flat directions” in the basis of QED × QCD-invariant operators which describe μ→e flavour change below mW.",
